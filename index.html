            Motor Racing Developments Ltd., commonly known as Brabham (/ˈbræbəm/ BRAB-əm), was a British racing car
            manufacturer and Formula One racing team. It was founded in 1960 by the Australian driver Jack Brabham and
            the British-Australian designer Ron Tauranac. The team had a successful thirty-year history, winning four
            FIA Formula One Drivers' and two Constructors' World Championships, starting with two successive wins in
            1966 and 1967. Jack Brabham's 1966 Drivers' Championship remains the only such achievement using a car
            bearing the driver's own name.
